# ðŸš¨ **[WebHole](https://github.com/yasserbdj96/WebHole)** â€“ Coming Soon 

I'm currently working on a powerful new project called **[WebHole](https://github.com/yasserbdj96/WebHole)** â€” a modern, multi-language web access and control platform inspired by the capabilities of **[HIPHP](https://github.com/yasserbdj96/hiphp)**.

**[HIPHP](https://github.com/yasserbdj96/hiphp)** is an open-source, PHP-based backdoor tool that allows secure, remote control over websites via HTTP/HTTPS. It supports file editing, downloading, and even Tor network integration, offering flexibility and password-protected security for site administrators.

Building on this foundation, **[WebHole](https://github.com/yasserbdj96/WebHole)** expands the concept beyond PHP â€” introducing support for multiple web languages while maintaining a strong focus on security, simplicity, and full control. It's designed for developers and webmasters who want a universal, open-source solution to manage and interact with their servers remotely without relying on third-party services.

> **Key Features (Planned):**
> - Multi-language support (not limited to PHP)
> - Encrypted and password-protected communication
> - File and server control from anywhere
> - Clean, developer-friendly interface

Stay tuned for the full release â€” **[WebHole](https://github.com/yasserbdj96/WebHole)** is set to redefine remote web management.
